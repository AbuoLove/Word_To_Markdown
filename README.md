# Word To Markdown

This is a very simple Windows console tool to convert simple `.docx` documents to `.md` documents.

****This application does NOT support  embedded images, hyperlinks, or text formatting beyond lists and nested lists, and section headers.****

****This application does NOT support detection of `.docx` headers, it only parses the body of the document.****

## How to Use

A `.zip` containing all necessary files to run the application [here.](https://github.com/BHolbs/Word_To_Markdown/raw/main/Deploy/Word_To_Markdown%20Release.zip)

Save and extract the `.zip` archive to your desired location. I suggest creating a shortcut to `Word_To_Markdown.exe` and placing it wherever you find useful.

Drag and drop `.docx` file(s) onto the executable, converted Markdown files will be written to your Desktop.
